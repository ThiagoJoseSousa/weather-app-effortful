# weather-app-effortful
proposed by Odin + some implementations of mine

Features: weather form is validated. OpenMapWeather API is used , loading icon while no response, old searched cities stay there and show either city or full data when clicked, page design is changed based on weather. fetch() was used.

Learned a lot about callbacks and events, also about promise.
I think I've learned about parse,stringify, object.keys, array.map and such as I was trying to apply localStorage in the div. But I have a compromise.
